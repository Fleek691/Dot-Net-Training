how to convert an object data into a xml serialize data in c#

Rules-must be public and properties must be public having get and set
Fields are converted into serialized values not functions
Xml Schema - XS
publisher and subscriber
jSon-better cause can store value in quotes on the lhs and rhs has value

Anonymus Data Types are created by Microsoft they do not have any names<--Very very important
a model(class) if we need to hide a property we make a new model called view model just for specifying what to display
thus we use anonymus to save memory as it only displays what parameters are used

Collection

   \/
Generics(similary operation and type specific)
Linq -used for better understanding and faster
Eg-from s in student
	(all the filtering and operations)
	select 
	
Delegate types->Predicate and Action

 written code gets converted into csharp objects 
 clr goes to them reads the binary code and provides information
 reflection-a way to get the info about the info the only way
 used for automation (during runtime u can create class)

// 1.    Get the values from the user.
Sam has started working as a freelancer. He got a project from a jewellery shop. The project requires Sam to manage jewellery details, which store the details of each piece of jewellery, including the ID, type, and material. The application will help the company manage their inventory more efficiently, allowing them to keep track of their stock and prices accurately.

Help him create an application that meets the requirements by using your C# skills.

Functionalities:

**In class Program:**
- `public static Dictionary<int, Jewellery> jewelleryDetails` (this dictionary is already provided)

**In class Jewellery, implement the following properties:**
| Data Type | Property Name |
|-----------|--------------|
| string    | Id           |
| string    | Type         |
| string    | Material     |
| int       | Price        |

**In class JwelleryUtility, implement the following methods:**

1. `public Dictionary<string, string> GetJewelleryDetails(string id)`
	- Gets the jewellery details from the dictionary `jewelleryDetails` based on the id passed as an argument.
	- If the id is available in `jewelleryDetails`, concatenate type and material using an underscore, then add the id and this value as a dictionary, and return it.
	  - Format: `<Jewellery id, Type_Material>`
	- If the id is not available in the dictionary, return an empty dictionary.

2. `public Dictionary<string, Jewellery> UpdateJewelleryPrice(string id, int price)`
	- Updates the price of the jewellery based on the id passed as an argument.
	- If the id is available in `jewelleryDetails`, update the price, store the updated details in the dictionary, and return it.
	- If the id is not available in the dictionary, return an empty dictionary.

**In Program class - Main method:**
1. Get the values from the user.
2. Call the methods accordingly and display the result as per the Sample Output.
	- If the `GetJewelleryDetails` method returns an empty dictionary, display "Jewellery id not found"
	- If the `UpdateJewelleryPrice` method returns an empty dictionary, display "Jewellery id not found"

**Note:**
- Keep the methods and classes as public.
- Please read the method rules clearly.
- Do not use `Environment.Exit()` to terminate the program.
- Do not change the given code template.

**Summary:**
Through working on this project, Sam has learned more about the generic collection Dictionary class in C#.
If you need, you can try this in your code also.
